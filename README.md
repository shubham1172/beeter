## What is it?  

A platform to beet you feelings and see what other people are beeting about. <br> 
This was hacked when I decided to teach myself some web dev under two days, as a result of which it is mostly incomplete. <br> <br>  
Back-end -> Node, Express, Passport and Mongoose. <br>  
Database -> MongoDB. <br>  
Front-end -> Bulma in Embedded JavaScript.   
   
   
## Install 
``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/shubham1172/beeter
$ npm install ``` 

**NOTE:** you can set the env variable `PORT` to run the app on a particular port. Default is `8080`. <br>

To run,   <br>
``` $ npm start ```
